NOTICE OF INTENT
-------------------------------------------------------------
This is not a part of the official or unofficial release of FruityWiFi.
I wrote this little script on my own because I am lazy and would
rather have a quick little menu. If others find it useful, great.
DO NOT bug the author/developer of FruityWiFi about anything in
this script. Send those bugs, suggestions, complaints, etc. to me
here on github.
